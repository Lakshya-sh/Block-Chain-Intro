# The Energy Equation: Sustainable Consensus Mechanisms for Tomorrow's Blockchain

## 📌 Project Description
This project explores sustainable blockchain consensus mechanisms. A smart contract enables voting on different consensus methods, with a simple frontend UI for user interaction.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To promote environmentally friendly blockchain mechanisms and encourage decentralized decision-making.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Smart contract with voting functionality.
- Three proposals: **Proof of Stake**, **Proof of Authority**, **Proof of Green**.
- Simple frontend to interact with the contract.
- Transparent vote counts accessible on-chain.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Expand to include more consensus mechanisms.
- Implement weighted voting for stakers.
- Create detailed analytics dashboards.
- Deploy on multiple blockchain testnets.
